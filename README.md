# About Ayo's Chatbot

##
I have a chat room that allows people to communicate to each other. I wanted a very light and happy theme. This theme can be seen in my color scheme and in the chatbot responses

##
I incorporated my theme into my project by using bright colors(blue ).
##
I struggled with sending the client and server messages. I solved this by looking at the button example and researching on events. I struggled with pushing to heroku, I fixed this updating my requirements file. I struggled getting the chat messages to show up in a sequential way. I also struggled woith react components and setting up my database. I fixed some of these issues by looking at the slides and doing some research.

##
My project right now has my yelp API response but I was not able to parse that data and send it to my client. Also, I have some tests set up but I have troubles with getting my tests to run with cricleCI.

##
I would improve this project making sure the name of the user is displayed alongside their text. I will also ensure that I incorporate my API and only allow the user to sign in after they logged in.
